# HPC Landscape

Walkthroughs, documentation and training material for making best use of the Turing’s HPC resouces.

## Overview

The Turing has access to a multitude of HPC resources.
For example:

1. Azure - CPU and GPU instances, Azure ML.
2. Baskerville - Intel Xeon CPUs and Nvidia A100 GPUs
3. JADE2 - Intel Xeon CPUs and Nvidia V100 GPUs
4. Dawn - Intel Xeon CPUs and Intel Data Centre Max 1550 GPUs
5. Isambard-AI - Nvidia Grace Hopper superchips (ARM CPUs, H100 GPUs)

See the [Research Computing site](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/page/3291) on Mathison for a full list of available computing resources.

This repository collects together useful walkthroughs developed in-house at the Turing to make use of these HPC resources more manageable and effective.

## Structure

The repository is structured by compute resource.
Some material may be relevant to multiple systems and where this is the case we’ve tried to make this clear.

## Document generation

At present we rely on GitHub’s markdown capabilities to display content.
In the future we may switch to using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) or [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Contributing

We welcome contributions.
If you’d like to contribute, please submit a pull request to the repository in the normal way.
This will be reviewed by the Research Computing Platforms team prior to merging.
